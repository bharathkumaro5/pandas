# pandas

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.). It's similar to a column in a table.
DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a table or a spreadsheet, where each column is a Series.

Data Handling:
Reading and Writing Data: Easily read data from various sources such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, and more. Similarly, it can export data to these formats.
Data Selection and Filtering: Provides powerful tools for selecting, filtering, and transforming data based on conditions.

Handling Missing Data: Includes functions to detect, fill, or drop missing values.

Data Transformation:
Reshaping Data: Features such as pivot tables, melting, and stacking/unstacking data to reshape and rearrange data for analysis.
Merging and Joining: Combines multiple DataFrames using various join operations (e.g., inner, outer, left, right joins).
Grouping and Aggregating: Supports grouping data by certain criteria and applying aggregate functions (mean, sum, count, etc.).

Data Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Provides functions to compute summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Time Series Analysis: Supports operations on time-series data, including date/time indexing, resampling, and rolling window calculations.
Data Visualization: While Pandas itself has basic plotting capabilities through integration with Matplotlib, it also works well with other visualization libraries.
